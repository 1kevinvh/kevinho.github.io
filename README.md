## Projects

**[What should be Bellabeat's marketeting strategy?](https://github.com/1kevinvh/CS-bellabeat-marketing.git)**
  - Conducted exploratory data analysis on Fitbit device data using **Python**, **pandas**, **NumPy**, and **matplotlib** in **Jupyter Notebook** to understand user behavior and activity trends.
  - Cleaned and prepared a real-world dataset by standardizing formats, checking data types, removing duplicates and outliers, and enhancing time-series features (e.g., day of the week).
  - Identified key behavioral insights: most users are lightly active, with positive correlations between active minutes, steps taken, and calories burned.
  - Derived data-driven marketing strategies targeting lightly active users and weight-loss-focused demographics to align product messaging with user behavior.
  - Visualized trends in user activity across the week and by activity level to support executive-level recommendations
  - Presented actionable insights and strategic recommendations to guide Bellabeat’s product positioning and marketing approach.

**[PowerBI Data Visualization: Superstore Sales](https://github.com/1kevinvh/PowerBI-Visualization.git)**
  - Designed and developed an interactive Power BI dashboard using Superstore Sales data to visualize key business metrics including revenue, orders, shipping time, and customer segmentation.
  - Created custom Overview, Orders, and Revenue tabs to provide stakeholders with clear insights into business performance across multiple dimensions.
  - Utilized Power Query Editor to clean and transform data: reformatted dates, created calculated columns (e.g., shipping time), and ensured proper data modeling for accurate analysis.
  - Built visualizations including clustered column charts, line graphs, shape maps, bar charts, donut charts, and KPI cards to display performance trends, sales distribution, and operational efficiency.
  - Developed custom slicers and navigation buttons to enhance dashboard interactivity and user experience.
  - Highlighted regional performance by mapping order and revenue density by state, helping identify high-performing areas for targeted marketing.

**[Data Analysis for Actionable Insights: Mall Customers](https://github.com/1kevinvh/Customer-Demographics-and-Spending-Behavior-Analysis.git)**
  - Performed comprehensive customer segmentation analysis using Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib) in Jupyter Notebook to uncover spending trends across demographic groups.
  - Cleaned and prepared the dataset by verifying data types, checking for null values, and creating new variables (e.g., age groups, spending percentiles) to enhance analytical depth.
  - Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand relationships between age, income, gender, and spending behavior, including correlation analysis and visualizations (histograms, scatterplots, box plots).
  - Identified that customers aged 26–35 are the highest spenders, providing a clear target demographic for future marketing campaigns.
  - Discovered that income has no strong correlation with spending score, suggesting potential for premium product strategies or personalized incentives for high-income, low-spending customers.
  - Found that while men earn more, women tend to spend more, offering insight for gender-based marketing and mall store inventory decisions.
  - Isolated and analyzed the top 20% of spenders to propose loyalty and rewards program strategies focused on high-value customer retention.
  - Delivered actionable business insights to guide targeted marketing, customer engagement, and merchandising strategies based on data-driven evidence.
    
**[SQL Data Exploration: WSDA Music Shop Discrepancy](https://github.com/1kevinvh/SQL-Data-Exploration.git)**
  - Analyzed a relational database using SQLite and SQL to identify a financial discrepancy within a fictional music company between 2011 and 2012.
  - Queried invoice, customer, and employee data to calculate total transactions, revenue, and average transaction amounts during the suspected time frame.
  - Created subqueries and aggregation logic to isolate high-value transactions and employees generating above-average sales.
  - Developed a commission payout model (15%) to determine financial gain by employee and identified anomalies in commission earnings.
  - Pinpointed suspicious behavior by correlating employee and customer data, highlighting one sales rep (Jane Peacock) and customer (John Doeein) with disproportionately high transactions.
  - Delivered final insights identifying a primary suspect in the financial discrepancy based on sales concentration and unusual customer behavior.
  - Demonstrated practical knowledge in data joins, subqueries, conditional filters, and data validation using SQL for investigative business use cases.

**[How can Cyclistic gain more subscribers?](https://github.com/1kevinvh/CS-cyclistic-subscribers.git)**
  - Used Python (pandas, matplotlib) to clean, merge, and analyze 4 quarterly datasets totaling over 1 million rows that exceeded Excel’s capacity.
  - Standardized inconsistent column headers, filtered outliers, and converted time formats for improved readability and data integrity.
  - Engineered new date-based features (month, day, weekday) to analyze rider behavior by temporal trends.
  - Identified that 77% of riders were subscribers, with non-subscribers averaging 62% longer trip durations, suggesting different usage patterns.
  - Discovered key behavioral trends: subscribers ride more on weekdays, while non-subscribers favor weekends, especially during Q3 (peak in July).
  - Created clear visualizations comparing ride frequency, trip duration, and user type to inform marketing insights.
  - Recommended targeted marketing strategies such as incentives for long or weekend rides to convert non-subscribers into subscribers.
